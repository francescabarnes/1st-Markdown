# Hey there, I'm Francesca :v:

---

## I'm training to become a Full-Stack Web Developer

---

_Originally from London, somehow found my home in Brussels, discovering the world and all the joys it has to offer_

### My wierd and wonderful skills

- Collecting and never finishing a book
- I can kill houseplants really quickly but I can't stop buying them
- I can finish jigsaw's pretty fast

### The best things I've discovered so far

- Cold brew coffee
- Spanakopita
- My dog

### Objective's during Becode

Discovering my full potential and learning to enjoy the struggle

### Things I find scary

- Not being perfect on first try

### What gives me hope for the future

To keep on powering through and to remember that I'll laugh in a couple months of how and with what I was struggling now with.

### What I value in a team

- Cooperation
- Creative problem solving
- Knowledge sharing
